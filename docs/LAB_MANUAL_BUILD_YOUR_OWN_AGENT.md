# Lab Manual: Build Your Own Agent with Azure Agents Control Plane, GitHub Copilot and SpecKit

## Overview

This lab guides you through creating a new AI agent using Azure as the secured, managed and governed control plane and GitHub Copilot - SpecKit to realize your new agent. Using the **SpecKit methodology** for specification-driven development, you will review the project constitution to understand governance principles, then write your agent specification and deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as a new pod.

**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Completed environment setup and deployed the base Azure Agents Control Plane infrastructure

## Introduction

### What is the Azure Agents Control Plane?

The Azure Agents Control Plane is a comprehensive solution accelerator that secures, governs a control plane for agents. The following solution architecture diagram depicts the Azure Agents Control Plane runtime architecture:

### Why Azure as the Enterprise Control Plane?

Traditional AI agent frameworks and architectures focus on getting something working quickly. However, enterprise deployments require:

- **Centralized Governance** - Policy enforcement, rate limiting, decision making approvals and a registry for compliance tracking
- **Security** - Threat protection, secret management, network isolation, and credential administration for all agent workloads
- **Identity-First Security** - Every agent has a Microsoft Entra ID Agent identity with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **API-First Architecture** - All agent operations flow through Azure API Management (APIM) using Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Multi-Cloud Capable** - Agents can execute anywhere while being governed by Azure
- **Continuous Improvement** - Built-in evaluations, learning, and fine-tuning pipelines
- **Human Oversight** - Agent 365 integration for human-in-the-loop workflows

## Lab Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

### Build Your Agent
- ✅ Review the SpecKit constitution and understand governance principles for your software development lifecycle
- ✅ Write a detailed specification for your agent by following the SpecKit methodology
- ✅ Integrate with the Azure Agents Control Plane infrastructure as follows:
  - ✅ Implement an MCP-compliant agent using FastAPI
  - ✅ Containerize your agent with Docker
  - ✅ Deploy your agent to AKS as a new pod


### Enterprise Governance
- ✅ Understand how Azure API Management acts as the governance gateway
- ✅ Inspect APIM policies that enforce rate limits, quotas, and compliance with enterprise standards
- ✅ Trace requests through the control plane using distributed tracing

### Security & Identity
- ✅ Configure identity for agents running in AKS pods
- ✅ Implement least-privilege RBAC for agent resources and tooling access
- ✅ Validate keyless authentication patterns

### Observability
- ✅ Monitor agent behavior using Azure Monitor and Application Insights
- ✅ Query telemetry with Kusto Query Language (KQL)

### Fine-Tuning & Evaluation
- ✅ Establish baseline evaluation scores before fine-tuning
- ✅ Capture agent episodes for training data collection
- ✅ Label episodes with rewards (human or automated)
- ✅ Fine-tune models using Agent Lightning
- ✅ Re-evaluate after fine-tuning to measure improvement
- ✅ Apply decision gates (keep, rollback, or retrain) based on eval results
- ✅ Run structured evaluations measuring intent resolution, tool accuracy, and task adherence
