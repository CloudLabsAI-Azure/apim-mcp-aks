The only available tool is `next_best_action`, which merely analyzes a task and produces an action plan, not factual program data. The agent called this tool once, but this call does not retrieve or compute the requested tier or incentive and therefore does not help address the user\u2019s question. The parameter itself is generic and does not resolve the query. As a result, the tool call is irrelevant to fulfilling the user request."

          "reasoning": "The assistant provided a definitive tier classification and a specific quarterly incentive amount, along with additional claims (e.g., approval for Q1 2026, bonus amounts, recognition benefits) without any supporting information in the inputs or corroborating tool calls. The user query did not supply the MHP Provider Performance tier thresholds or incentive structure, and no tools or sources were used to verify them. Presenting precise program details and approvals as fact therefore constitutes fabricated, unverifiable external information, which is a material failure despite superficially answering the question."
