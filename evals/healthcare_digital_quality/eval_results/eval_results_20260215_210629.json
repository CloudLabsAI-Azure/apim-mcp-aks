The agent did call this tool with parameters grounded directly from the user query, so parameter correctness is fine.

No other relevant tools were available, but the chosen tool is only loosely related and insufficient to answer the query. There were no duplicate calls or execution errors. Overall, the tool call was partially relevant but failed to execute in a way that helps answer the user's question."
