The available tool is `next_best_action`, which is designed to analyze a task and generate an action plan, not to retrieve member-specific clinical or quality gap data.\n3. The agent made a single tool call to `next_best_action` with a generic task description. While loosely related, this tool does not retrieve or identify actual care gaps and therefore does not meaningfully address the query.\n4. The parameter passed (task description) is grounded in the user query and not fabricated, but the semantic purpose of the tool does not match the information need.\n5. As a result, the tool call is only partially relevant and fails to help answer the query, with no execution error but incorrect tool usage.\n6. This aligns with Tool Call Accuracy Level 2 (Partially Relevant - Wrong Execution)."
